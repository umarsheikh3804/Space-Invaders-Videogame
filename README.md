- Recreated 90â€™s-style Space Invaders game on TM4C microcontroller using responsive hardware, such as interfaced buttons, LEDs, ADC slide potentiometers, DAC speakers, and LCD screens. 

- Configured IO hardware, SPI communication, and edge interrupts, and programmed back-end logic (gameplay, user-input, screen output) in C.
